          <h2>The Beginning</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Audrey Parker and I was born in Austin, Texas on
            September 6, 1996. To Amanda Farmer and Jonathon Parker. I was their
            first and only child. They brought me home to their trailer in the
            country. When I was two my father's mental illness-schizo-affective
            bipolar- became very apparent and too much my mother, which led to
            their split. I moved with my mom and attended several different
            elementary schools. We moved all the time, even lived in her car at
            one point. During this time, we had been keeping poor company. My
            mother met a man that would father my two younger sisters, Shyamme,
            and Jolie. He was very abusive and unreliable. I had to call the
            police several times for domestic abuse. This led to problems at
            school, where I made friends that were not friends... I started
            getting into trouble, and ended up in alternative school a few times
            for making poor choices. Eventually, my mother moved us to Hutto, TX
            to get me away from the dark path I was headed down, and away from
            the man that abused her. Our lives started to change.

          <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
          <p>
            I started my sophomore year at Hutto high school, a small town with
            and entirely different culture than I was used to. I made good
            friends, joined the tennis team, had my first real relationship, and
            grew up here. I applied to college and was accepted to my top choice
            at A&M Corpus Christi; I live for the ocean!
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to put off college for a year because one month after I
            graduated my sisters were taken by CPS and placed with my aunt. I
            had to stay to help her care for them as she worked long hours. I
            look at this as a blessing in disguise though, if I had gone to
            Corpus that year, I wouldn't have met my husband. The next year I
            was able to go to A&M Corpus Christi, where I met my husband, who
            was my next door neighbor. I wouldn't have met him if I had gone the
            year before.

          <h2>Twenties</h2>
          <p>
            My husband and I married in 2017 after one year of dating. We were
            21 at the time. Young and wild. He decided to join the Air Force
            prompting our move to San Antonio. At this time we decided to have
            our first child as well. We moved to San Antonio in January of 2020
            while I was 6 months pregnant with our son. He left for basic
            training in February, and one month later COVID hit. Lockdown began
            and I was alone in a new city. My little sister came to visit three
            days before lockdown, and had to move in with me. My mother suffered
            a mental breakdown prompting us to take custody of my sister. My
            father also went through an episode, and he was missing for three
            weeks. COVID was the most difficult time of my life.

            I gave birth to our son in May of 2020, and we bought our first
            house in 2021, in San Antonio. During this time we had custody of my
            sister, just had our son, and my mother moved in with us to rebuild
            her Life after everything happened... I Graduated college in
            decemebr of 2021 with a degree in Education from UTSA. I taught for
            three years in
            <a href="https://www.eisd.net/" target="_blank">Edgewood ISD</a>
            and became pregnant with our daughter. After she was born in 2023
            things changed for us. We become homesick, realizing we needed our
            family in our lives, and San Antonio was just too far away. I also
            grew tired of teaching... coming home so exhausted every day, and
            not being able to give proper attention to my children drained me.
            This led to me looking into a career change. I came across a free
            web development course so I attended, and I was hooked. I realized
            this is something I highly enjoy doing, and it is a career that can
            provide a better work-life balance, so I can be present for my
            children. I am so excited to move forward in tech and create things
            that I am proud of.
